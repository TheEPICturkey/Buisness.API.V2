To whom this may concern,


        The previous projects Ive made the mistake of doing a global init and having multiple projects added to my repo.
     Unfortunately, I have not learned my lesson. Therefore I had to delete git folder. I had 17(?) commits in total, starting thursday and ending sometime around friday evening. I apologize, and am making this note partially to let you know, but also for me to look back on and remember to:
     (1) Initialize Git in the project folder, not globally.
     (2) Check GitHub after initial commit.

     If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.
