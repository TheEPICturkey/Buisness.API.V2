# Local Business Lookup Api

#### By Brandon Spear

#### Brief Description of Application

Application Allows Users to find Businesses around them.

## Technologies Used

- _C#_
- _Entity Framework Core_
- _MySQL_
- _ASP.NET Core MVC_
- _Swagger_

## Description

This is an application that allows the user to make Get, Post, Put, Delete requests to the BusinessApi in order to find local stores. One may be able to find a specific store with the unique id of the business and they may also filter the amount of store they would like to see at a given time.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone this repository to your desktop:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/TheEPICturkey/Buisness.API.V2.git
```

- Navigate to the Business.API.V2 directory on your desktop and open the cloned directory with your favorite text editor (Visual Studio Code was used when setting this project up).

- Navigate into the Business Api production directory and run the code:

```
    $ dotnet restore
```

- Within the production directory, create a new file called `appsettings.json`.

- Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL Workbench. Please install MySQL Workbench if not already installed on your local machine.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME];uid=[YOUR_ID];pwd=[YOUR_PASSWORD];"
  }
}
```

- To launch the API, run the following codes in the production directory:

```
    $ dotnet build
```

```
    $ dotnet watch run
```

## Re-creating the Database

1. Launch MySQL Workbench and open your local instance.
2. Then follow [this link](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/database-basics/introduction-to-mysql-workbench-creating-a-database) with instructions to create a database, based on the data from the `Models` directory.
3. You may also use migrations to create and update your database without having to manually create them yourself. Follow [this link](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/many-to-many-relationships/code-first-development-and-migrations) for instructions to install the right tools.
4. There should only be one table called `Businesses`.
